          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Poverty, Age</h2>
          <p>United States residents that live at, near, or below the U.S. Federal poverty line are more 
            likely to smoke.  (The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) in 2018 was calculated as $12,140 for an individual
            and $25,100 for a family of 4.)  As seen in the above graph, the states with the highest percentage
            of residents living in poverty have the highest percentage of smokers.  For example, the cluster of states
            with the highest poverty rates (Mississippi, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Alabama), have greater than 19% of
            residents that smoke.
          </p>

          <p>Switching the graph to show the relationship between age and smoking produces interesting results.
            Most of the states have smokers between the ages of 36 and 40.  The state with the highest percentage
            of smokers, West Virginia, shows an average age of 42 for those with a smoking habit.  A potential
            bright spot in this analysis is that the younger generation is less likely to smoke than those approaching 
            middle age.
